Guess I left you shell-shocked, baby
Didn't mean to cry so hard
You were minding your own business
You said, "Not in my back yard"

[Chorus]
Turn me inside out (what's inside of you?)
Turn me inside out (and I am you)
Turn me inside out (what's inside of you?)
Turn me inside out (and I am you)

Trying to get through to you, baby
Working on a sunken mind
All for one and none for all, maybe
Brother, can you spare a dime?

[Chorus]

Guess I should have thought fast, but I
Guess I had no sense at all
Can you get to heaven faster
If you build a higher wall?

[Chorus]

For all of you who talk but don't do
You have used up your last I.O.U.
I am telling you because I am through
I get nothing for loving you

Turn me inside out (what's inside of you?)
Come on and (and I am you)
I dare you (what's inside of you?)
Turn me inside out (and I am you)
[Chorus]

For all of you who talk but don't do
You have used up your last I.O.U.
I am telling you because I am through
I get nothing for loving you
(Loving you, loving you)
