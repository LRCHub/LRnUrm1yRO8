You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
And I don't have the slightest doubt
Cos I can see
Cos I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
No doubt that I am open
In total disarray
Scaring that I've found for what I've been hoping
Yet I choose to play
The puller of the fantasy of bliss
Pulls me to your presence
Silly to fear what I've missed
Brought you to my essence
I'm inside out
You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
And I don't have the slightest doubt
Cos I can see
Cos I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
Love shall not invade me
Pursue it I shall
Hearts intwine my mission
The tolling of the bells
Lonely when you found me
Depressed I am no more
The games of games have ceased
Love you to the core
I'm inside out
You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
Inside out boy
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
Inside
And I don't have the slightest doubt
Cos I can see
Cos I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
Cos I can see
I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
Inside out
Inside out
Yeah baby
Yeah-yeah-yeah
I can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
I can see
I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
