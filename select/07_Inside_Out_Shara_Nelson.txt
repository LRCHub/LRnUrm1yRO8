I don't wanna change the way I feel
I'm even prepared to go with your flow
These feelings just crept up on me now
I realize without you I'm not home

Feelin' shy to tell you the truth
Feelin' alone when I can't arrest the way I feel to you

I guess

All I want you in my life somewhere
And I guess it's cause you know me, shada
And I want you in my life somewhere
And I guess it's cause you know me inside out

Those little things you used to say
Still bring me hope for a brand new day
I'm full of things I never had
Toyin' with ideas you gave to me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
And tell the world cause I'm so proud
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
And tell the world cause I'm so proud

Oh I want you in my life somewhere
And I guess it's cause you know me, shada
And I want you in my life somewhere
And I guess it's cause you know me inside and out
